           Jesus said, "I have called him to teach with patience and wisdom. I have placed truth in his mouth and compassion in his heart. He stands before others as a teacher by profession, yet his greater calling is to shepherd minds and souls toward light.
            I have given him a song for worship and a voice that carries My presence. When he sings, heaven listens. When he speaks My Word, seeds are planted. When he ministers in prophecy, he listens carefully for My whisper and releases hope where hearts are weary.
            His life remains anchored in devotion to Me. His love for people reflects My own heart. Through every lesson taught, every melody lifted, and every message declared, My purpose moves forward."

              <h3>Teaching</h3>
              <p>I have called him to teach with wisdom and steadiness. He brings structure where minds need clarity and patience where growth takes time. He does not rush the process. He guides with intention and corrects with care.

Encouragement flows through his words. Confidence rises in those he leads. Strength develops through consistency. In every lesson, he reflects My heart by shaping understanding with grace and purpose.

              <h3>Worship</h3>
              <p>I have formed his heart for worship. Reverence rises within him, steady and sincere. He approaches My presence with humility and awe, never for display, always for devotion.

Consistency marks his praise. Whether in quiet moments or before many voices, his song remains faithful. His worship flows from love, anchored in truth, devoted to My name, Jesus.

Through his surrender and steadfastness, others are invited to draw near.</p>

              <h3>Preaching</h3>
              <p>I have called him to preach with clarity. Truth flows plainly from his mouth, steady and understandable, so that hearts may grasp what I am saying.

Conviction burns within him. He does not speak to impress, only to obey. My Word rests deeply in his spirit, and he releases that Word with boldness and integrity.

Compassion shapes his message. Correction carries kindness. Strength carries mercy. Through his voice, I draw people closer to Me, revealing that I am one, and My name is Jesus.</p>

              <h3>Service</h3>
              <p>I have shaped him for service. He does not begin what he will not finish. Follow through marks his character, and faithfulness strengthens every assignment placed in his hands.

Support flows naturally from him. He stands beside others, lifting burdens without seeking applause. His presence brings stability where pressure rises.

Steadiness anchors his steps. He remains dependable in private and in public. Through quiet consistency and committed action, he reflects My heart and honors My name, Jesus.</p>
